        I am an Front-end Developer & UI Developer. Focused on creating things
        with interactions and animations. With a knack for turning problems and
        opportunities into user-driven strategic solutions with delightful and
        intuitive interface design.

        I enjoy spending time fixing minor details and learning new things about
        web development, particularly front-end and UI development, in order to
        improve my skills and knowledge. Also I like working in a team, you'll
        learn faster and much more. â€œAs the saying goes, two heads are better
        than one.
